# Using SCSS for your projects
Technically, HTML only understands CSS, not (the superior) SCSS. We need a "compiler", or something that turns SCSS into regular CSS. 

Live Sass Compiler is an example of a SCSS compiler. You've already installed it when setting up VSCode, but we will now be using this extension.

---

If you have an `index.html` and a `style.scss` in your project directory, run the extension by clicking `Watch Sass` on the bottom toolbar. There is also a `settings.json` (found in this repo) tuned by Mr. Whalen if you want to use his settings for the extension. Ask Mr. Whalen for any further questions setting up SCSS for your own project.
